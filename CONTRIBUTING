If you are adding an official PDF, please make sure to match the official naming scheme & CHECK THE MD5 HASH. Any PDFs that fail a hash check will be rejected.

If you are adding a pirated or alternate version, please make a filename that will NOT CONFLICT with the official naming scheme.

The official release PDF, verified by MD5 hash, is the preffered version EXCEPT when it has been censored. Non-preffered versions will be happily accepted as well, so that neighbors can enjoy things like their censored polyglot versions along with their uncensored copies.
